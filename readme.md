Equivariant recursively embedded atom neural network 
=================================================
**Introduction:**
___________________________
  Equivariant recursively embedded atom neural network (EquiREANN) is a PyTorch-based end-to-end multi-functional Deep Neural Network Package for Molecular, Reactive and Periodic Systems. Currently, EquiREANN can be used to train interatomic potentials, dipole moments, transition dipole moments, and polarizabilities. Taking advantage of Distributed DataParallel features embedded in PyTorch, the training process is highly parallelized on both GPU and CPU. For the convenience of MD simulation, an interface to LAMMPS has been constructed by creating a new pair_style invoking this representation for highly efficient MD simulations
  
As a calculator, EquiREANN can be used with Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE), you can read the readme in ASE/ folder for interface and the website to know how to use ASE:
